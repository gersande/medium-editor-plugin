Medium Editor Plugin
====================

<<<<<<< HEAD
Based on Davi Ferreira's pure (https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor)[JavaScript Medium Editor].

==Note to Self== 
The reason why it's not really working yet is because I don't know how to do this: 
`<script>
	var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable');
</script>
<script>
	var elements = document.querySelectorAll('.editable'),
	    editor = new MediumEditor(elements);
</script>`
